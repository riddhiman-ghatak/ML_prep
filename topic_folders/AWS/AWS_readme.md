## üß† Learning Path Suggestion for ML Focus

1. Learn core AWS (IAM, EC2, S3, VPC)
2. Dive deep into **SageMaker**
3. Explore **data services** (Glue, Redshift, DynamoDB)
4. Learn **pre-trained AI services** for fast prototyping
5. Expand into **MLOps** (Pipelines, CI/CD, monitoring)
6. Work on a **capstone ML project using SageMaker**
